    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** In this notebook, I focused on building machine learning models and considered how useful the mean value is as a predictor. First, I partitioned the data into training and testing splits so that I can have an independent assessment of how the model might perform in the future. After, to determine how good the mean is as a predictor, I found the average price on the training split. To determine how good the mean is, I used R^2, coefficient of determination, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (ticket price) that is predicted by the \"model\". The test set resulted in R^2 = -0.02469 and it is common to see performance slightly worse on a test set versus on a training set. Mean absolute error and mean squared error summarizes the difference between predicted and actual values. On average, we might expect to be off by around $19 if you guessed ticket price based on an average of known values. The mean squared error converts us back to our measurement space by taking the square root of the mean absolute error. This can all be done using Sklearn metrics so that we don't have to define functions every time we want to assess performance. Rather than using the mean, I experimented with the median to see if we could get a better mean absolute error. To do this, we filled missing predictor values with the median ticket prices, scaled the data using StandardScaler which scales each feature to zero mean and unit variance, trained the model on the train split, made predictions using the model on both train and test splits, assessed model performance, and used skilean to find the mean absolute error. Using the median gave us an estimate ticket price within $9 or so of the real price. Compared to the $19 difference we got using the mean, this is a much better result. To refine the linear model, SelectKBest can be used. This selects the k best features, but this can take some trial and error. Instead, we can use cross validation which partitions the training set into k fold, trains the model on k-1 of those folds, and calculates performance on the fold not used in training. With cross validation, we discovered a good value for k is 8. Random forest model is a model that can work very well in a lot of cases, as it stops bad practice of repeatedly checking performance on the test split. This allows us to go straight from defining the pipeline to assessing performance using cross validation. Through this model, we identified that the dominant top four features in common with our linear model are fastQuads, Runs, SnowMaking_ac, and vertical_drop. In the end, we identified that the random forest model has a lower cross validation mean absolute error by almost $1 and also exhibits less variability in comparition to the linear model. Therefore, our final model selection was the random forest model. Lastly, we did a data quantity assessment to see if more or less data is useful. The learning_curve function assesses the trade off of more/less data by seeing how performance varies with differing data set sizes. We saw that there is an initial rapid improvement in model scores but around sample size of 40-50, it levels off. "
